If you discover a security vulnerability in the Awesome Sauce Token Marketplace, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Disclose Publicly
Please do not create GitHub issues or discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.

### 2. Contact Information
- **Email**: security@awesomesaucetoken.com
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

### 3. Include in Your Report
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include PoC code (non-destructive)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 4. Responsible Disclosure Timeline
- **Day 0**: Report received and acknowledged
- **Day 1-3**: Initial assessment and triage
- **Day 7**: Detailed investigation and fix development
- **Day 14**: Fix implemented and tested
- **Day 21**: Fix deployed to production
- **Day 30**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

## Security Measures

### Current Security Implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms for admin functions
- **CORS**: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Headers**: Security headers implemented via Helmet.js
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits of npm dependencies

### AI System Security
- **Bounded Exploration**: AI pricing adjustments are constrained within safe limits
- **Input Sanitization**: All AI inputs are validated before processing
- **Rate Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of AI decision patterns
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to quickly revert AI-driven changes

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege applied
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Docker containers with minimal attack surface
- **Network Security**: Secure network configurations and firewalls
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 monitoring of security events
- **Backup & Recovery**: Secure backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority
- **Remote Code Execution**: Any vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution
- **SQL Injection**: Database injection vulnerabilities
- **Authentication Bypass**: Ability to bypass authentication mechanisms
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access to admin functions
- **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive user data

### Medium Priority
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Client-side code injection
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized actions on behalf of users
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposure of non-sensitive system information
- **Denial of Service**: Vulnerabilities causing service unavailability

### Low Priority
- **Rate Limit Bypass**: Minor rate limiting issues
- **Information Leakage**: Minor information disclosure
- **Configuration Issues**: Non-critical misconfigurations

## Bug Bounty Program

### Scope
- **In Scope**: 
  - Main marketplace application (*.awesomesaucetoken.com)
  - API endpoints (/api/*)
  - AI optimization systems
  - Authentication and authorization
  
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Third-party integrations
  - Social engineering attacks
  - Physical security
  - DDoS attacks

### Rewards
- **Critical**: $500 - $2000
- **High**: $200 - $500
- **Medium**: $50 - $200
- **Low**: $25 - $50

### Rules
- Must follow responsible disclosure
- No testing on production systems without permission
- No data destruction or modification
- No spam or social engineering
- One vulnerability per report
