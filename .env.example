# --- Security Notes ---
# 1. NEVER commit a populated PRIVATE_KEY to git.
# 2. For production set ENABLE_REAL_TRADES=true only after validating dryâ€‘run performance.
# 3. Rotate keys immediately if they were ever exposed.
# 4. Use a dedicated low-balance hot wallet for the bot; keep treasury funds separate.
